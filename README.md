## ⚠️ this repo is experimental ⚠️

like the heading and branch name suggest, this repo is **experimental** and should not be used for production/daily usage.

the compilation steps are the same as the stable branch, though you might have to install new pkgs as i will be experimenting with new pkgs, so keep that in mind.

i will be testing stuff out here, get feedback, then push to master.

think of this as a nightly update, or a "whenever i feel like it" update.

also please dont forget to give me feedback, im trying to do the best i can.
